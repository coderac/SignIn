<p>If you are writing any non trivial web application you will surely notice that using a single view for your main page doesnâ€™t allow for a good separation of concerns.

    Most screens will deal with a few concerns, specially if our application wants to provide some notification area or summary information. This is specially problematic if you are working in a dashboard or control center type of application.

    Angular have a nice directive to help you to separate your UI in discreet components in the way of include files.</p>
